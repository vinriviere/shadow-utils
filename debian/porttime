# /etc/porttime contains user time restrictions.
# See porttime(5).

# If you add restrictions to this file, be sure that
# PORTTIME_CHECKS_ENAB is set to `yes' in /etc/login.defs. logoutd(8)
# will be started automatically on bootup if this file contains
# non-comment lines.  You may also start it manually with
# `/etc/init.d/logoutd start'.
