.TH LASTLOG 8
.SH NAME
lastlog \- examine lastlog file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lastlog
.RB [ -u
.IR login-name ]
.RB [ -t
.IR days ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlastlog\fR formats and prints the contents of the last login log,
\fI/var/log/lastlog\fR.  The \fBlogin-name\fR, \fBport\fR, and \fBlast login 
time\fR will be printed.
The default (no flags) causes lastlog entries to be printed, sorted
by the numerical UID.
Entering \fB-u \fIlogin-name\fR flag will
cause the lastlog record for \fIlogin-name\fR only to be printed.
Entering \fB-t \fIdays\fR will cause only the
lastlogins more recent than \fIdays\fR to be printed.
The \fB-t\fR flag overrides the use of \fB-u\fR.
.PP
If the user has never logged in the message \fB"**Never logged in**"\fR will 
be displayed instead of the port and time.
.SH FILES
/var/log/lastlog \- lastlog logging file
.SH CAVEATS
Large gaps in uid numbers will cause the lastlog program to run longer with
no output to the screen (i.e. if mmdf=800 and last uid=170, program will
appear to hang as it processes uid 171-799).
